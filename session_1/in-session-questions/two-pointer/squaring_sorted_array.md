Given a sorted input_list,
create a new input_list containing squares of all the numbers from the input input_list
in sorted (ascending) order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].


Example 2:

Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]


Example 3:

Input: [-2, -1, 0, 2, 3]
Output: [0, 1, 4, 4, 9]


Example 4:

Input: [-3, -1, 0, 1, 2]     -> 9, 1, 0, 1, 4
Output: [0, 1, 1, 4, 9]
