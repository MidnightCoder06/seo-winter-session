* recursive frame stacks is one way we can measure space complexity of tree problems
* stackoverflow website terms comes from this 


The term Recursion can be defined as the process of defining something in terms of itself.

It's when a function calls itself.

A complicated function can be split down into smaller sub-problems utilizing recursion.

What is a recursive function 
-->  It means that a function calls itself. This has the benefit of meaning that you can loop through data to reach a result.

```

def fn():
    # ...
    fn()
    # ...

```

```

def fn():
    # ...
    if condition:
        # stop calling itself
    else:
        fn()
    # ...

```

* base case
* recursive case

The base case is the condition to stop the recursion. 
The recursive case is the part where the function calls on itself

```

def countdown(n):
    print(n)
    if n == 0:
        return
    else:
        countdown(n - 1)

>>> countdown(5)
5
4
3
2
1
0

```

Notice how countdown() fits the paradigm for a recursive algorithm described above:

The base case occurs when n is zero, at which point recursion stops.
In the recursive call, the argument is one less than the current value of n, so each recursion moves closer to the base case.


Hereâ€™s one possible non-recursive implementation for comparison:

```

def countdown(n):
    while n >= 0:
        print(n)
        n -= 1

>>> countdown(5)
5
4
3
2
1
0

```
