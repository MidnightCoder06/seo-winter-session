You're given a node class that has a name and an array of optional children nodes. When put together, the nodes form an acycle tree-like structure.

Implement a depth first search method on the Node class, which takes in an empty array, traverses teh tree, stores all the  nodes' names in the input array, and then returns it.



Time:
0(v + e)


Space:
0(v) 
where v is the number of vertices of the input graph and e is number of edges of the input graph
